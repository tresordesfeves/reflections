When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
how to establish the link between my local repos and my remote GITHUB:
> git remote add origin https://github.com/tresordesfeves/reflections.git
then to verify that origin (the "local transfer chamber" has been created:
> git remote (result will be "origin")
> git remote -v (-v like in verbose) will show you the patch between origin and the remote GITHUB repo.
then to ush the branch (here the branch to push is "master")
>git push origin master ( you have to mention which branch you want to push : here for example "master")
same concept to pull from the remote into the local
>git pull origin master 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
- branch is done internaly on one repo ( either local or remoted)
- fork is a cloning done on Github ( from one user to an other)
- clone is from GitHub to local ( or local to local)

To clone you have to cd into the the directory where you want the new repo ( a clone of the original repo) to be created: the new directory (repo) will be created automatically . (here for example we cd into version-control, then we cloned receipe from our remote on Github into our local :(copy the URL in the GitHub repo ("clone or Download" green button))
    >git clone https://github.com/tresordesfeves/recipes.git
 automaticaly a sub directory (recipes) was created in version-control. and you got cd into this new directory.

When you clone a repo from Github into your local repos, the remote is automaticaly created (and can be used for future push or pull) (you can check it out by using  > git remote - v   to see the link between origin and remote). 

How to see the difference beween local and remote?
>git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
        (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
        nothing to commit, working tree clean
then to update the remote use :
>git push origin master 

To authorize collaborator to push to your remote directory/repo: go onto the remote? setting/add collabotators
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
a local copy of the remote bramch is labeled origin/master
Local copy of he remote branch, local branch and remote branch are identical right after a pull or a push.
On the contrary a >git fetch origin    will only updqte the locql copy of the remte branch, NOT THE LOCAL BRANCH ITSELF!!!
>git fetch origin  FOLOWED BY
>git merge master origin/master IS THE SAME THEN
>git pull origin master

>git log origin/master will list all the comits of the local copy of the remote when it was laste updated (meaning after the ast, push or pull or fetch)

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
to establish the link between my local repos and my remote GITHUB:
> git remote add origin https://github.com/tresordesfeves/reflections.git
then to verify that origin (the "local transfer chamber" has been created:
> git remote (result will be "origin")
then to ush the branch (here the branch to push is "master")
>git push origin master 
same concept to pull from the remote into the local
>git pull origin master 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
